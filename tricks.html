                <h2>Drop-Ins</h2>
                <p class="text">Drop In means to enter a quarter from the top coping. This is the most important thing to learn if you want to ride transitions. Therefore, it’s the foundation of every other trick you can do in a mini ramp or a quarter.
                Nevertheless, it takes some guts at first to head into a transition and lean forward with your board. But the fear will go away fast and after a few tries you won’t even think about it as a trick. Once you feel comfortable doing Drop Ins on a quarter pipe try to drop in on something a bit higher and see how high you can go.</p>

                <h2>Ollie</h2>
                <p class="text">The Ollie is the first trick you should learn when you start skateboarding. Even though the Ollie is nothing more than a simple jump, this trick is essential for everything that follows. You’ll need this basic every time you are on your board and will hopefully never forget it again.</p>

                <h2>Kickflip</h2>
                <p class="text">A Kickflip is often the first flip trick learned and in some way the coronation for every skateboarder. Contrary to most peoples opinion, the Kickflip wasn’t invented by Rodney Mullen but by freestyle skateboard pioneer Curt Lindgren in 1978. But you still should credit Mullen because the way Kickflips are done today goes back to a modification he brought into skateboarding in 1982. With a Kickflip the board flips but does not turn like when you do a Pop Shove-It.

                <h2>Rock To Fakie</h2>
                <p class="text">A Rock to Fakie is a basic lip trick with the difficulty to roll out backwards into the transition.
                    In the beginning that might feel a bit strange but after a while you’ll get into it. The Rock to Fakie is essential to get into the right position for Fakie tricks.
